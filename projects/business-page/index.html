                <h2>Our story: More than just a coffee</h2>
                <p>What started as a way to make someones day turned into a full coffee experience.

                    Beginning with a simple game of guessing the color inside my coffee mug. I quickly noticed that it
                    felt like there was a little extra caffeine in my coffee on days that I guessed right."

                    Now, our coffee shop brings this fun experience to life, offering moments of connection and
                    excitement with every cup.

                    Whether it’s the Color Guessing Game, a quick laugh at the register, or taking a selfie with the
                    famous Banana Bread Latte, we believe the little things can turn a routine into something
                    meaningful. We’re here to create those moments. Consistently. Intentionally. With heart.
