                <h4>Latina Pathways’ First Generation Student Mixer creates a student community</h4>
                <p>By Angelina Nunez

                    Latina Pathways hosted their First-Generation Student Mixer at Stamp Student Union on Tuesday, Nov.
                    5. The event brimmed with music, food, dancing and games.

                    Latina Pathways is a non-profit student-led organization that aims to empower Latine immigrants in
                    higher education. The group hosts many fundraising events throughout the year, including at least
                    seven this semester.

                    The profits from the fundraisers go toward the UndocuTerp scholarship, which helps to financially
                    support undocumented students with their college expenses.

                    Latina Pathways also organizes many non-fundraising events throughout the year, including the Board
                    & Brew, a game night with drinks and pan dulce, and Paint & Sip, an evening with mocktails and
                    canvas painting. Through these events, students can get involved with the organization and connect
                    with one another.

                    Erica Rodriguez, a senior pre-nursing and psychology major and the president of Latina Pathways,
                    recognized first-generation students’ unique accomplishments on behalf of the organization.

                    “We want to acknowledge the hard work, resilience, and determination of first-generation students.
                    Your achievements are inspiring, and we are incredibly proud of you. Your determination is something
                    to be celebrated, and we stand beside you in support,” Rodriguez said. “No matter the challenges we
                    face, we are stronger together.”</p>

                <p>For first-generation students, college can be an intimidating atmosphere. Oscar Fuentes, a sophomore
                    government and politics major and the research officer for Latina Pathways, expressed the importance
                    of these events.

                    “For first-generation students, it can be very scary,” Fuentes said. “It’s definitely more of an
                    opportunity to [know] you’re not alone, make friends, make connections, enjoy college.”

                    Yeicy Ramirez, a sophomore secondary education and Spanish major and the social media chair of
                    Latina Pathways, emphasized how the chapter focuses on undocumented Latines who want to receive a
                    higher education.

                    “I understand the struggles that they face, and I may not be undocumented, but with my parents being
                    immigrants, I know the struggle of that…any way that we can help is honestly great,” Ramirez said.

                    She explained how Latina Pathways positively impacts undocumented students, which motivates her
                    ongoing support for the organization.

                    The first-generation mixer created an environment — through a night filled with bachata dancing,
                    laughter and UNO games — that fostered connections between Latines from many different walks of
                    life, helping to keep the community alive. </p>
